== Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

== Types of tests

We have three types of tests:

.  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
.  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
.  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: Keyboard and mouse movements are not simulated on macOS Mojave, resulting in GUI Tests failure.**

* Reason: From macOS Mojave onwards, applications without `Accessibility` permission cannot simulate certain keyboard and mouse movements.
* Solution: Open `System Preferences`, click `Security and Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility`, and check the box beside `Intellij IDEA`.

.`Accessibility` permission is granted to `IntelliJ IDEA`
