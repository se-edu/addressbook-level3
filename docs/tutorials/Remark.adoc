== Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the implementation of a new command -- `remark`.

This command allows users of the AddressBook application to add optional remarks to people in their address book and edit it if required.
The command should have the format of `remark INDEX r/REMARK`.
An example of the command is `remark 2 r/Likes baseball`.

We'll assume that you have already set up the development environment as outlined in the Developer's Guide.

=== Create a new `Command`

Looking in the `logic.command` package, you will notice that each existing command have their own class.
All the commands implement `Command` which means that they must override `execute()`.
Each `Command` returns an instance of `CommandResult` upon success and throws a `CommandException` otherwise.
This exception is handled gracefully -- the error message provided to `CommandException` is shown in the `ResultDisplay`.

Let's start by creating a new `RemarkCommand` class in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/command` directory.

For now, let's keep `RemarkCommand` as simple as possible and return a message that it is not fully implemented yet.
We accomplish that by throwing a `CommandException` with an accompanying error message.

.RemarkCommand.java
[source, java]
----
package seedu.address.logic.commands;

import static seedu.address.logic.parser.CliSyntax.PREFIX_REMARK;

import seedu.address.logic.commands.exceptions.CommandException;
import seedu.address.model.Model;

/**
 * Changes the remark of an existing person in the address book.
 */
public class RemarkCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "remark";

    public static final String MESSAGE_USAGE = COMMAND_WORD + ": Edits the remark of the person identified "
            + "by the index number used in the last person listing. "
            + "Existing remark will be overwritten by the input.\n"
            + "Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) "
            + PREFIX_REMARK + "[REMARK]\n"
            + "Example: " + COMMAND_WORD + " 1 "
            + PREFIX_REMARK + "Likes to swim.";

    public static final String MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET = "Remark command not implemented yet";

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET);
    }
}
----

NOTE: Remember to add `PREFIX_REMARK` to the `CliSyntax` class!

Check out the code for the `RemarkCommand` link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/72256eacea79dfcf077f5c7cb6f89819c02f090e#diff-34ace715a8a8d2e5a66e71289f017b47[here].
Feel free to copy and paste this.

=== Hook `RemarkCommand` into the application

Now that we have our `RemarkCommand` ready to be executed, we need to update `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to recognize the `remark` keyword.
Add the new command to the switch-case and return a new instance of `RemarkCommand`.

You can refer to the changes in this link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/72256eacea79dfcf077f5c7cb6f89819c02f090e#diff-5338391f3f6fbb4022c44add6590b74f[diff].

=== Run the application

Run `Main#main` and try out your new `RemarkCommand`.
If everything went well, you should see something like this:

.Output displayed
image::RemarkNotImplemented.png[]

== Enhancing `RemarkCommand`

While we have gotten AddressBook to recognize our new command, it does not parse input any input from the user.
Let's change that.

=== Make the command accept parameters

We start by modifying the constructor of `RemarkCommand` to accept an `Index` and a `String`.
While we are at it, let's change the error message to echo the values.
While this is not a replacement for tests, it is an obvious way to tell if our code is functioning as intended.

[source, java]
----
private final Index index;
private final String remark;

/**
 * @param index of the person in the filtered person list to edit the remark
 * @param remark of the person to be updated to
 */
public RemarkCommand(Index index, String remark) {
    requireAllNonNull(index, remark);

    this.index = index;
    this.remark = remark;
}
@Override
public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
    throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_ARGUMENTS, index.getOneBased(), remark));
}
----

Your code should look something like link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/c0f8419be4fb59bffafcd73026769459e5cf5c5e#diff-34ace715a8a8d2e5a66e71289f017b47[this] after you are done.

=== Parse user input

Now let's move on to writing a parser that will extract the index and remark from the input provided by the user.

Create a `RemarkCommandParser` class in the `seedu.address.logic.parser` package.
The class must extend the `Parser` interface.

.UML diagram describing the relationship between Parser and RemarkCommandParser
image::ParserInterface.png[]

Thankfully, `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` makes it trivial to parse user input.
Let's take a look at the JavaDoc provided for the function to understand what it does.

[source, java]
.ArgumentTokenizer.java
----
/**
 * Tokenizes an arguments string and returns an {@code ArgumentMultimap}
 * object that maps prefixes to their respective argument values. Only the
 * given prefixes will be recognized in the arguments string.
 *
 * @param argsString Arguments string of the form:
 * {@code preamble <prefix>value <prefix>value ...}
 * @param prefixes   Prefixes to tokenize the arguments string with
 * @return           ArgumentMultimap object that maps prefixes to their
 * arguments
 */
----

We can tell `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to look out for our new prefix `r/` and it will return us an instance of `ArgumentMultimap`.
Now let's find out what we need to do in order to obtain the Index and String that we need.
Let's look through `ArgumentMultimap` :

[source, java]
.ArgumentMultimap.java
----
/**
 * Returns the last value of {@code prefix}.
 */
public Optional<String> getValue(Prefix prefix) {
    List<String> values = getAllValues(prefix);
    return values.isEmpty() ? Optional.empty() :
        Optional.of(values.get(values.size() - 1));
}
----

This appears to be what we need to get a String of the remark.
But what about the Index? Taking a quick peek at existing an `Command`...

[source, java]
.DeleteCommandParser.java
----
Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
return new DeleteCommand(index);
----

There appears to be another utility class that obtains an `Index` from the input provided by the user.

Now that we have the know-how to extract the data that we need from the user's input, we can create a new instance of `RemarkCommand`.

[source, java]
.RemarkCommandParser.java
----
public RemarkCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    requireNonNull(args);
    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args,
        PREFIX_REMARK);

    Index index;
    try {
        index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argMultimap.getPreamble());
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
            RemarkCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE), ive);
    }

    String remark = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_REMARK).orElse("");

    return new RemarkCommand(index, remark);
}
----

NOTE: Don't forget to update `AddressBookParser` to use our new `RemarkCommandParser`!

If you are stuck, check out the sample link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/c0f8419be4fb59bffafcd73026769459e5cf5c5e#diff-fc19ecee89c3732a62fbc8c840250508[here].

== Adding to the model

Now that we have all the information that we need, let's lay the groundwork for some _persistent_ changes.
We acheive that by working with the `Person` model.
Each field in a Person is implemented as a separate class (e.g. a Name object represents the person's name).
That means we should add a Remark class so that we can use a Remark object to represent a remark given to a person.
This protects them from illegal access and allows us to tightly couple logic specific to the field.

=== Add a new `Remark` class

Create a new `Remark` in `seedu.address.model.person`. Since a `Remark` is a field that is similar to `Address`, we can reuse a significant bit of code.

A quick copy-paste and search-replace later, you should have something like link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/c8e6048f0d81f2b4b7797e838226da823892129b#diff-af2f075d24dfcd333876f0fbce321f25[this].

=== Make use of `Remark`

Let's change `RemarkCommand` and `RemarkCommandParser` to use the new `Remark` class instead of plain `String`.
These should be relatively simple changes.

== Adding placeholder elements to the UI

Without getting too deep into `fxml`, let's go on a 5 minute adventure to get some placeholder text to show up for each person.

Simply add
```
@FXML
private Label remark;
```
to link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/06f9897d7088d22689de478c94612f8bcbff2964#diff-0c6b6abcfac8c205e075294f25e851fe[`PersonCard`].
`@FXML` is an annotation that marks a private or protected field and makes it accessible to FXML.
It might sound like Greek to you right now, don't worry -- we will get back to it later.

Then insert

```
<Label fx:id="remark" styleClass="cell_small_label" text="\$remark" />
```
into link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/06f9897d7088d22689de478c94612f8bcbff2964#diff-12580431f55d7880578aa4c16f249e71[`PersonListCard.fxml`].

That's it! Fire up the application again and you should see something like this:

.$remark shows up in each entry
image::$Remark.png[]

== Updating the model

Since `PersonCard` displays data from a `Person`, we need to update `Person` to get our `Remark` displayed!

=== Modify `Person`

We change the constructor of `Person` to take a `Remark`.
We will also need to define new fields accordingly to store our new addition.

=== Update other usages of `Person`

Unfortunately, a change to `Person` will cause other commands to break, let's fix these commands to use the updated `Person`!

== Updating Storage

AddressBook stores data by serializing `JsonAdaptedPerson` into `json` with the help of an external library -- Jackson.
Let's update `JsonAdaptedPerson` to work with our new `Person`!

While the changes to code may be minimal, the test data will have to be updated as well.

Check out link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/78b2a7438a9f9d828b7f09e190ff6130790966c0[this commit] to see what the changes entail.

== Finalizing the UI

Now that we have finalized the `Person` class and its dependencies, we can now bind the `Remark` field to the UI.

Just add link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/2edaf1c52e07e28dc7a49742bc63352813a55af9[this one line of code!]
[source, java]
.PersonCard.java
----
public PersonCard(Person person, int displayedIndex) {
    //...
    remark.setText(person.getRemark().value);
}
----

.The remark label is bound properly!
image::RemarkBound.png[]

== Putting everything together

After the previous step, we notice a peculiar regression -- we went from displaying something to nothing at all.
However, this is expected behavior as we have never changed `Remark` at all!

=== Change `Remark`

In this last step, we modify `RemarkCommand#execute()` to change the `Remark` of a `Person`.
Since all fields in a `Person` are immutable, we create a new instance of a `Person` with the values that we want and save it with `Model#setPerson()`.

.Congratulations!
image::RemarkComplete.png[]

== Writing tests

Tests are crucial to ensuring that bugs don't slip into the codebase unnoticed. This is especially true for large
code bases where a change might lead to unintended behavior.

Let's verify the correctness of our code by writing some tests!

=== Automagically generating tests

The goal is to write effective and efficient tests to ensure that `RemarkCommand#execute()` behaves as expected.

The convention for test names is _``methodName_testScenario_expectedResult``_.
An example would be `execute_filteredList_success`.

Let's create a test for `RemarkCommand#execute()` to test that adding a remark works.
On `IntelliJ IDEA` you can bring up the context menu and choose to `Go To` > `Test` or use the appropriate keyboard shortcut.

.Using the context menu to jump to tests
image::ContextMenu.png[, 1223px, 267px]

Then, create a test for the `execute` method.

.Creating a test for `execute`.
image::CreateTest.png[, 664px,751px]

Following convention, let's change the name of the generated method to `execute_addRemarkUnfilteredList_success`.

Let's use the utility functions provided in `CommandTestUtil`. The functions ensure that commands produce the expected `CommandResult` and output the correct message.
In this case, `CommandTestUtil#assertCommandSuccess` is the best fit as we are testing that a `RemarkCommand` will successfully add a `Remark`.

You should end up with a test that looks something like
link:https://github.com/j-lum/addressbook-level35/commit/1492fb0d4e8a075f2481028377e0d113e7c01b76#diff-d749de38392f7ea504da7824641ba8d9[this].

== Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial for adding a new `Command` to AddressBook.
