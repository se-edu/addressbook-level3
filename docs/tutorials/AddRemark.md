title: "Tutorial: Adding a command"

Let's walk you through the implementation of a new command — `remark`.

This command allows users of the AddressBook application to add optional remarks to people in their address book and edit it if required. The command should have the following format:

`remark INDEX r/REMARK` (e.g., `remark 2 r/Likes baseball`)

We’ll assume that you have already set up the development environment as outlined in the Developer’s Guide.


## Create a new `remark` command

Looking in the `logic.command` package, you will notice that each existing command have their own class. All the commands inherit from the abstract class `Command` which means that they must override `execute()`. Each `Command` returns an instance of `CommandResult` upon success and `CommandResult#feedbackToUser` is printed to the `ResultDisplay`.

Let’s start by creating a new `RemarkCommand` class in the `src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/command` directory.

For now, let’s keep `RemarkCommand` as simple as possible and print some output. We accomplish that by returning a `CommandResult` with an accompanying message.

**`RemarkCommand.java`:**

``` java
package seedu.address.logic.commands;

import seedu.address.model.Model;

/**
 * Changes the remark of an existing person in the address book.
 */
public class RemarkCommand extends Command {

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "remark";

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) {
        return new CommandResult("Hello from remark");
    }
}
```

### Hook `RemarkCommand` into the application

Now that we have our `RemarkCommand` ready to be executed, we need to update `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to recognize the `remark` keyword. Add the new command to the `switch` block by creating a new `case` that returns a new instance of `RemarkCommand`.

You can refer to the changes in this [diff](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/35eb7286f18a029d39cb7a29df8f172a001e4fd8#diff-34ace715a8a8d2e5a66e71289f017b47).

### Run the application

Run `Main#main` and try out your new `RemarkCommand`. If everything went well, you should see something like this:

![Output displayed](../images/add-remark/RemarkHello.png)

## Change `RemarkCommand` to throw an exception

While we have successfully printed a message to `ResultDisplay`, the command does not do what it is supposed to do. Let’s change the command to throw a `CommandException` to accurately reflect that our command is still a work in progress.

![The relationship between RemarkCommand and Command](../images/add-remark/CommandInterface.png)

Following the convention in other commands, we add relevant messages as constants and use them.

**`RemarkCommand.java`:**

``` java
    public static final String MESSAGE_USAGE = COMMAND_WORD + ": Edits the remark of the person identified "
            + "by the index number used in the last person listing. "
            + "Existing remark will be overwritten by the input.\n"
            + "Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer) "
            + "r/ [REMARK]\n"
            + "Example: " + COMMAND_WORD + " 1 "
            + "r/ Likes to swim.";

    public static final String MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET = "Remark command not implemented yet";

    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
        throw new CommandException(MESSAGE_NOT_IMPLEMENTED_YET);
    }
```

## Enhancing `RemarkCommand`

Let’s change `RemarkCommand` to parse input from the user.

### Make the command accept parameters

We start by modifying the constructor of `RemarkCommand` to accept an `Index` and a `String`. While we are at it, let’s change the error message to echo the values. While this is not a replacement for tests, it is an obvious way to tell if our code is functioning as intended.

``` java
import static seedu.address.commons.util.CollectionUtil.requireAllNonNull;
//...
public class RemarkCommand extends Command {
    //...
    public static final String MESSAGE_ARGUMENTS = "Index: %1$d, Remark: %2$s";

    private final Index index;
    private final String remark;

    /**
     * @param index of the person in the filtered person list to edit the remark
     * @param remark of the person to be updated to
     */
    public RemarkCommand(Index index, String remark) {
        requireAllNonNull(index, remark);

        this.index = index;
        this.remark = remark;
    }
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
        throw new CommandException(String.format(MESSAGE_ARGUMENTS, index.getOneBased(), remark));
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object other) {
        // short circuit if same object
        if (other == this) {
            return true;
        }

        // instanceof handles nulls
        if (!(other instanceof RemarkCommand)) {
            return false;
        }

        // state check
        RemarkCommand e = (RemarkCommand) other;
        return index.equals(e.index)
                && remark.equals(e.remark);
    }
}
```

Your code should look something like [this](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/35eb7286f18a029d39cb7a29df8f172a001e4fd8#diff-34ace715a8a8d2e5a66e71289f017b47) after you are done.

### Parse user input

Now let’s move on to writing a parser that will extract the index and remark from the input provided by the user.

Create a `RemarkCommandParser` class in the `seedu.address.logic.parser` package. The class must extend the `Parser` interface.

![The relationship between Parser and RemarkCommandParser](../images/add-remark/ParserInterface.png)

Thankfully, `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` makes it trivial to parse user input. Let’s take a look at the JavaDoc provided for the function to understand what it does.

**`ArgumentTokenizer.java`:**

``` java
/**
 * Tokenizes an arguments string and returns an {@code ArgumentMultimap}
 * object that maps prefixes to their respective argument values. Only the
 * given prefixes will be recognized in the arguments string.
 *
 * @param argsString Arguments string of the form:
 * {@code preamble <prefix>value <prefix>value ...}
 * @param prefixes   Prefixes to tokenize the arguments string with
 * @return           ArgumentMultimap object that maps prefixes to their
 * arguments
 */
```

We can tell `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to look out for our new prefix `r/` and it will return us an instance of `ArgumentMultimap`. Now let’s find out what we need to do in order to obtain the Index and String that we need. Let’s look through `ArgumentMultimap` :

**`ArgumentMultimap.java`:**

``` java
/**
 * Returns the last value of {@code prefix}.
 */
public Optional<String> getValue(Prefix prefix) {
    List<String> values = getAllValues(prefix);
    return values.isEmpty() ? Optional.empty() :
        Optional.of(values.get(values.size() - 1));
}
```

This appears to be what we need to get a String of the remark. But what about the Index? Let's take a quick peek at existing `Command` that uses an index to see how it is done.

**`DeleteCommandParser.java`:**

``` java
Index index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(args);
return new DeleteCommand(index);
```

There appears to be another utility class that obtains an `Index` from the input provided by the user.

Now that we have the know-how to extract the data that we need from the user’s input, we can parse the user command and create a new instance of `RemarkCommand`, as given below.

**`RemarkCommandParser.java`:**

``` java
public RemarkCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
    requireNonNull(args);
    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap = ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args,
        PREFIX_REMARK);

    Index index;
    try {
        index = ParserUtil.parseIndex(argMultimap.getPreamble());
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT,
            RemarkCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE), ive);
    }

    String remark = argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_REMARK).orElse("");

    return new RemarkCommand(index, remark);
}
```

:information_source: Don’t forget to update `AddressBookParser` to use our new `RemarkCommandParser`!

</div>

If you are stuck, check out the sample
[here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/dc6d5139d08f6403da0ec624ea32bd79a2ae0cbf#diff-fc19ecee89c3732a62fbc8c840250508).

## Add `Remark` to the model

Now that we have all the information that we need, let’s lay the groundwork for propagating the remarks added into the in-memory storage of person data. We achieve that by working with the `Person` model. Each field in a Person is implemented as a separate class (e.g. a `Name` object represents the person’s name). That means we should add a `Remark` class so that we can use a `Remark` object to represent a remark given to a person.

### Add a new `Remark` class

Create a new `Remark` in `seedu.address.model.person`. Since a `Remark` is a field that is similar to `Address`, we can reuse a significant bit of code.

A copy-paste and search-replace later, you should have something like [this](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/4516e099699baa9e2d51801bd26f016d812dedcc#diff-af2f075d24dfcd333876f0fbce321f25). Note how `Remark` has no constrains and thus does not require input
validation.

### Make use of `Remark`

Let’s change `RemarkCommand` and `RemarkCommandParser` to use the new `Remark` class instead of plain `String`. These should be relatively simple changes.

## Add a placeholder element for remark to the UI

Without getting too deep into `fxml`, let’s go on a 5 minute adventure to get some placeholder text to show up for each person.

Simply add the following to [`seedu.address.ui.PersonCard`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/850b78879582f38accb05dd20c245963c65ea599#diff-0c6b6abcfac8c205e075294f25e851fe).

**`PersonCard.java`:**

``` java
@FXML
private Label remark;
```


`@FXML` is an annotation that marks a private or protected field and makes it accessible to FXML. It might sound like Greek to you right now, don’t worry — we will get back to it later.

Then insert the following into [`main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/850b78879582f38accb05dd20c245963c65ea599#diff-12580431f55d7880578aa4c16f249e71).

**`PersonListCard.fxml`:**

``` xml
<Label fx:id="remark" styleClass="cell_small_label" text="\$remark" />
```

That’s it! Fire up the application again and you should see something like this:

![$remark shows up in each entry](../images/add-remark/$Remark.png)

## Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field

Since `PersonCard` displays data from a `Person`, we need to update `Person` to get our `Remark` displayed!

### Modify `Person`

We change the constructor of `Person` to take a `Remark`. We will also need to define new fields and accessors accordingly to store our new addition.

### Update other usages of `Person`

Unfortunately, a change to `Person` will cause other commands to break, you will have to modify these commands to use the updated `Person`!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: Use the `Find Usages` feature in IntelliJ IDEA on the `Person` class to find these commands.

</div>

Refer to [this commit](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/ce998c37e65b92d35c91d28c7822cd139c2c0a5c) and check that you have got everything in order!


## Updating Storage

AddressBook stores data by serializing `JsonAdaptedPerson` into `json` with the help of an external library — Jackson. Let’s update `JsonAdaptedPerson` to work with our new `Person`!

While the changes to code may be minimal, the test data will have to be updated as well.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: You must delete AddressBook’s storage file located at `/data/addressbook.json` before running it! Not doing so will cause AddressBook to default to an empty address book!

</div>

Check out [this commit](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/556cbd0e03ff224d7a68afba171ad2eb0ce56bbf)
to see what the changes entail.

## Finalizing the UI

Now that we have finalized the `Person` class and its dependencies, we can now bind the `Remark` field to the UI.

Just add [this one line of code!](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/5b98fee11b6b3f5749b6b943c4f3bd3aa049b692)

**`PersonCard.java`:**

``` java
public PersonCard(Person person, int displayedIndex) {
    //...
    remark.setText(person.getRemark().value);
}
```

![The remark label is bound properly!](../images/add-remark/RemarkBound.png)

## Putting everything together

After the previous step, we notice a peculiar regression — we went from displaying something to nothing at all. However, this is expected behavior as we are yet to update the `RemarkCommand` to make use of the code we've been adding in the last few steps.

### Update `RemarkCommand` and `RemarkCommandParser`

In this last step, we modify `RemarkCommand#execute()` to change the `Remark` of a `Person`. Since all fields in a `Person` are immutable, we create a new instance of a `Person` with the values that we want and
save it with `Model#setPerson()`.

**`RemarkCommand.java`:**

``` java
//...
    public static final String MESSAGE_ADD_REMARK_SUCCESS = "Added remark to Person: %1$s";
    public static final String MESSAGE_DELETE_REMARK_SUCCESS = "Removed remark from Person: %1$s";
//...
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) throws CommandException {
        List<Person> lastShownList = model.getFilteredPersonList();

        if (index.getZeroBased() >= lastShownList.size()) {
            throw new CommandException(Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_PERSON_DISPLAYED_INDEX);
        }

        Person personToEdit = lastShownList.get(index.getZeroBased());
        Person editedPerson = new Person(personToEdit.getName(), personToEdit.getPhone(), personToEdit.getEmail(),
                personToEdit.getAddress(), remark, personToEdit.getTags());

        model.setPerson(personToEdit, editedPerson);
        model.updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS);

        return new CommandResult(generateSuccessMessage(editedPerson));
    }

    /**
     * Generates a command execution success message based on whether the remark is added to or removed from
     * {@code personToEdit}.
     */
    private String generateSuccessMessage(Person personToEdit) {
        String message = !remark.value.isEmpty() ? MESSAGE_ADD_REMARK_SUCCESS : MESSAGE_DELETE_REMARK_SUCCESS;
        return String.format(message, personToEdit);
    }
```

![Congratulations!](../images/add-remark/RemarkComplete.png)

## Writing tests

Tests are crucial to ensuring that bugs don’t slip into the codebase unnoticed. This is especially true for large code bases where a change might lead to unintended behavior.

Let’s verify the correctness of our code by writing some tests!

### Automatically generating tests

The goal is to write effective and efficient tests to ensure that `RemarkCommand#execute()` behaves as expected.

The convention for test names is `methodName_testScenario_expectedResult`. An example would be
`execute_filteredList_success`.

Let’s create a test for `RemarkCommand#execute()` to test that adding a remark works. On `IntelliJ IDEA` you can bring up the context menu and choose to `Go To` \> `Test` or use the appropriate keyboard shortcut.

![Using the context menu to jump to tests](../images/add-remark/ContextMenu.png)

Then, create a test for the `execute` method.

![Creating a test for `execute`.](../images/add-remark/CreateTest.png)

Following convention, let’s change the name of the generated method to `execute_addRemarkUnfilteredList_success`.

Let’s use the utility functions provided in `CommandTestUtil`. The functions ensure that commands produce the expected `CommandResult` and output the correct message. In this case, `CommandTestUtil#assertCommandSuccess` is the best fit as we are testing that a `RemarkCommand` will successfully add a `Remark`.

You should end up with a test that looks something like [this](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/fac8f3fd855d55831ca0cc73313b5943d49d4d6e#diff-d749de38392f7ea504da7824641ba8d9).

## Conclusion

This concludes the tutorial for adding a new `Command` to AddressBook.
