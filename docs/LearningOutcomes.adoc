== Utilize User Stories `[LO-UserStories]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/specifyingRequirements/userStories/[se-edu/se-book: Requirements: Specifying Requirements: User Stories]

=== Exercise: Add more user stories

* Assume you are planing to expand the functionality of the AddressBook (but keep it as a CLI application).
What other user stories do you think AddressBook should support? Add those user stories to the `DeveloperGuide.adoc`.

== Utilize use cases `[LO-UseCases]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/[se-edu/se-book: Requirements: Specifying Requirements: Use Cases]

=== Exercise: Add a 'Rename tag' use case

* Add a use case to the `DeveloperGuide.adoc` to cover the case of _renaming of an existing tag_.
e.g. rename the tag `friends` to `buddies` (i.e. all persons who had the `friends` tag will now have
a `buddies` tag instead)
Assume that AddressBook confirms the change with the user before carrying out the operation.

== Use Non Functional Requirements `[LO-NFR]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/requirements/nonFunctionalRequirements/[se-edu/se-book: Requirements: Non-Functional Requirements]

=== Exercise: Add more NFRs

* Add some more NFRs to the `DeveloperGuide.adoc`

== Use Polymorphism `[LO-Polymorphism]`

Note how the `Command::execute()` method shows polymorphic behavior.

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/polymorphism/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Polymorphism]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/inheritance/polymorphism/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: OOP: Polymorphism]

=== Exercise: Add a polymorphic `isMutating` method

* Add a method `boolean isMutating()` to the `Command` class. This method will return `true` for
command types that mutate the data. e.g. `AddCommand`
* Currently, AddressBook data are saved to the file after every command.
Take advantage of the the new method you added to limit file saving to only for command types that mutate data.
i.e. `add` command should always save the data while `list` command should never save data to the file.

[NOTE]
====
There may be better ways to limit file saving to commands that mutate data. The above approach, while not
optimal, will give you chance to implement a polymorphic behavior.

== Use abstract classes/methods `[LO-Abstract]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/oop/inheritance/abstractClasses/[se-edu/se-book: Paradigms: OOP: Abstract Classes]
* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/inheritance/abstractClassesAndMethods/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: OOP: Abstract Classes]

=== Exercise: Make `Command#execute()` method abstract

* Make the `Command#execute()` method abstract (hint: refer to the comment given below the method)

== Use interfaces `[LO-Interfaces]`

Note how the `AddressBook` class implements the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` interface so that clients who don't need write access to the `AddressBook` can access the `AddressBook` through the `ReadOnlyAddressBook` interface instead.

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/cppToJava/inheritance/interfaces/[se-edu/se-book: C++ to Java: OOP: Abstract Interfaces]

=== Exercise: Add a `Printable` interface

* Add a `Printable` interface as follows.
+
image::PrintableInterface.png[width=400]
* `Override` the `getPrintableString` in classes `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, and `Address` so that each produces a printable string representation of the object. e.g. `Name: John Smith`, `Phone: 12349862`
* Add the following method in a suitable place of some other class. Note how the method depends on the Interface.
+
[source,java]
----
/**
 * Returns a concatenated version of the printable strings of each object.
 */
String getPrintableString(Printable... printables) {
----
+
The above method can be used to get a printable string representing a bunch of person details.
For example, you should be able to call that method like this:
+
[source,java]
----
// p is a Person object
return getPrintableString(p.getPhone(), p.getEmail(), p.getAddress());
----

== Follow Liskov Substitution Principle `[LO-LSP]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/principles/liskovSubstitutionPrinciple/[se-edu/se-book: Principles: Liskov Substitution Principle]

=== Exercise: Add an exception to an overridden method

* Add a `throws Exception` clause to the `AddCommand::execute` method. Notice how Java compiler will not allow it,
unless you add the same `throws` clause to the parent class method. This is because if a child class throws
an exception that is not specified by the Parent's contract, the child class is no longer substitutable in place of
the parent class.
* Also note that while in the above example the compiler enforces LSP, there are other situations where it is up to
the programmer to enforce it. For example, if the method in the parent class works for `null` input, the overridden
method in the child class should not reject `null` inputs. This will not be enforced by the compiler.

== Use Java-FX for GUI programming `[LO-JavaFx]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/javaTools/javaFXBasic/[se-edu/se-book: Tools: Java: JavaFX: Basic]

=== Exercise: Enhance GUI

* Do some enhancements to the AddressBook GUI. e.g. add an application icon, change font size/style

== Analyze Coupling and Cohesion of designs `[LO-CouplingCohesion]`

* Notice how having a separate `ParserUtil` class to handle user input validation, space trimming etc. of model data (an application of the Single Responsibility Principle) improves the _cohesion_ of the model component (since it does not need to be concerned with handling user input) as well as the `ParserUtil` class.

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/designFundamentals/cohesion/[se-edu/se-book: Design: Design Principles: Cohesion]

=== Exercise: Identify places to reduce coupling and increase cohesion

* Where else in the design coupling can be reduced further, or cohesion can be increased further?

== Apply Dependency Inversion Principle `[LO-DIP]`

* Note how the `LogicManager` class doesn't depend on `StorageManager` directly, but rather the interface `Storage`.
This is an application of the Dependency Inversion Principle.
+
image::LogicStorageDIP.png[width=300]
* Where else in the code do you notice the application of DIP?

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/principles/dependencyInversionPrinciple/[se-edu/se-book: Principles: Dependency Inversion Principle]

== Use Dependency Injection `[LO-DI]`

Notice how the `LogicManager` class does not depend on the `StorageManager` class, but depends on the `Storage` interface.
This allows us to use _Dependency Injection_ to test the `LogicManager` class without getting the `StorageManager` class involved.

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/testing/dependencyInjection/[se-edu/se-book: Quality Assurance: Testing: Dependency Injection]

=== Exercise: Facilitate injecting a StorageStub

* Notice how `LogicManagerTest` tests `LogicManager` by constructing a `StorageManager` object.
* Implement `StorageStub` such that calls to its `save*` methods do nothing (i.e. empty method body).
* Update `LogicManagerTest` to work with the `StorageStub` instead of the actual `StorageManager` object.
i.e. `LogicManagerTest` injects a `StorageStub` object when constructing a `LogicManager` before testing it.
+
image::DependencyInjection.png[width=600]
* The example above uses <<apply-dependency-inversion-principle-lo-dip, DIP>> as a means to achieve DI.
Note that there is another way to inject a `StorageStub` object, as shown below.
In this case we do not apply the DIP but we still achieve DI.

== Apply Open-Closed Principle `[LO-OCP]`

=== References

* https://se-edu.github.io/se-book/principles/openClosedPrinciple/[se-edu/se-book: Principles: Open-Closed Principle]

=== Exercise: Analyze OCP-compliance of the `LogicManager` class

* Consider adding a new command to the Address Book. e.g. an `edit` command. Notice how little you need to change in the `LogicManager` class to extend its behavior so that it can execute the new command.
That is because `LogicManager` follows the OCP i.e. `LogicManager` is _open to be extended_ with more commands but _closed for modifications_.
* Is it possible to make the `AddressBookParser` class more OCP-compliant in terms of extending it to handle more
command types?
* In terms of how it saves data, is `LogicManager` more OCP-compliant
due to the application of DIP as given in <<apply-dependency-inversion-principle-lo-dip, `LO-DIP`>>?
How can you improve ``LogicManager``'s OCP-compliance further so that it can not only work with different types
of storages, but different number of storages (e.g. save to both a text file and a database).

== Work in a 3KLoC code base `[LO-3KLoC]`

=== Exercise: Enhance AddressBook

* Enhance AddressBook in some way. e.g. add a new command
