# Logging guide

* We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
* The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.
*  The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level.
*  Log messages are output through the console and to a `.log` file.
*  The output logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See the [Configuration guide](Configuration.md) section).
* **When choosing a level for a log message**, follow the conventions given in [_[se-edu/guides] Java: Logging conventions_](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/logging.html).
