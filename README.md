  - This is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of
    the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

  - It is a Java sample application intended for students learning
    Software Engineering while using Java as the main programming
    language.

  - It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably
    well-written** code example that is **significantly bigger** (around
    6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE
    modules.
